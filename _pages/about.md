Hi! I am Mingqi, a research student in [College of Computer Science, Chongqing University](http://www.cs.cqu.edu.cn/ywb/About_College_of_Computer.htm), under the supervision of [Prof. Hengxin Chen](http://www.cs.cqu.edu.cn/info/1141/1671.htm). Previously, I received my M.Eng and B.Eng from [Chongqing University](http://english.cqu.edu.cn) and [Inner Mongilia University](http://www.imu.edu.cn/#) in 2017 and 2014 respectively. My research interests include Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, particularly in [Active Contour Model, Level Set Method](https://gaomingqi.github.io/posts/2016/12/blog-post-1/) for image segmentation. 

Currently, I am working on more accurate segmentation method by combining _Deep Learning Theory_.
